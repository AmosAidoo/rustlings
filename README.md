# Rustlings Progress

Welcome to my Rustlings progress tracker! This repository documents my journey through the Rustlings exercises as I learn and master Rust programming.

## About Rustlings

[Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) is a collection of small exercises designed to help you get comfortable reading and writing Rust code. The exercises cover various topics, from basic syntax to advanced concepts.
